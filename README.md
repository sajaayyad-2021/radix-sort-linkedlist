# radix-sort-linkedlist
A C project that demonstrates the application of doubly linked lists in implementing Radix Sort. The program reads strings from a file, sorts them using a non-comparative sorting method, and provides features like insertion, deletion, 
and file saving. Built as part of a Data Structures course.

# Radix Sort Using Doubly Linked List

This project implements a non-linear data structure using a doubly linked list to perform radix sort on a list of strings. It provides functionalities to:
- Load strings from a file
- Display the list before and after sorting
- Add or delete strings from the list
- Save the result to an output file

## Features
- File input/output support
- Space-padding for radix sort
- Case normalization (convert to lowercase)
- Full menu-based CLI

## Compilation
```bash
gcc main.c -o radix_sort
