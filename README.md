# radix-sort-linkedlist
A C project that demonstrates the application of doubly linked lists in implementing Radix Sort. The program reads strings from a file, sorts them using a non-comparative sorting method, and provides features like insertion, deletion, and file saving. Built as part of a Data Structures course.
